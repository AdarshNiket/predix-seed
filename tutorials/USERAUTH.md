# Predix UI Seed Tutorial : User Authentication

## Introduction
Web applications almost always involve information that is not for public consumption, and that should be access-controlled.  For this reason one of the most common features required for a real-world application that of authentication.  Users of the application will need to login in order to access the information, and perform any further interaction.

This tutorial shows how to add authentication (login/logout) features to an instance of the Predix UI Seed, specifically the type involving a separate authentication site/service such as UAA.
